# DGTJ

DGTJ stands for Dynamicly Generated Tic Tac Toe JavaScript

## What it all means?

The main idea for this was to create dynamicly-generated tic tac toe game. Dynamicly-generated means that user can select how many cells should have every side of board (baecause it's square shape). User can chose signs and priority for players (there are teams available ).

## How it works

First you see the page - it could be confusing

In the first input you should add some number. For example we can type "3".
Next there is field "players", so you should add players signs (there is no matter if you press space bar, it will use only signs), now we can add for examlpe "xo" or "x o" (both will be the same).

If you press "reset" button it will generate new board. That's time for som gameplay! Feel fre to test how it works.

For addition there's mechanism that provides highlighting everyone winning field.
