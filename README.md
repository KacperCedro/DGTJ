# DGTJ

DGTJ stands for Dynamicly Generated Tic Tac Toe JavaScript

## What it all means?

The main idea for this was to create dynamicly-generated tic tac toe game. Dynamicly-generated means that user can select how many cells should have every side of board (baecause it's square shape). User can chose signs and priority for players (there are teams available ).

## How it works

First you see the page - it could be confusing
